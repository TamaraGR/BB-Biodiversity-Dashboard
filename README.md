# Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset For The Volunteer Participants

## Project Description 

A synthetic beef manufacturing company has partnered with a microbiology lab that is 
researching bacteria that has the ability to sythesize proteins taht taste like beef. 
The microbiology lab has a hypothesis that the best beef-like taste can be synthesized 
from the bacteria found in the human belly button area.

To further test that hypothesis, the lab and the synthetic beef company have a group of
volunteers provide their belly button area bacteria. The above dashboard allows each 
volunteer pull th assigned to them number from the drop down menu. When a volunteer finds 
his assigned number in the meny, they can access various statistics about their personal bacteria.
